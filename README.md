It use deep seq2seq model that shown as below. This is a end to end model, so there are no preprocessing for
 the input of output or any of stage in the middle, it's a complete deep learning model.

## what's the specialty of this virtual assistant?

This virtual assistant can handle multiple command such as "open the bluetooth and darken the screen". As I know, SIRI can't do this.
